Pre-Alpha 
The game will change dramatically over time. 
As of 7/25/24. 
You can get berries by clicking the berry bush and after ten seconds of playing you need the amount of food equal to the amount of citizens per second. 
Try to get as many citizens as possible. 
There is no lose state yet so if your citizen amount is less than 2 than you can restart the program.
